Heather loves math, graphs, and contemplating metaphysical philosophies. She also loves to dance. She was born in Southampton, NY but attended high school in NY’s beautiful Hudson Valley. She was a cheerleader, band geek, photographer, member of the art guild and a publishing poet. A self-proclaimed ‘renaissance woman,’ Heather wants to know a little bit about everything. She spends a lot of time in her own head, but also likes to work with her hands. You are most likely to find her counting stitches while making a creation with some yarn and a crochet hook.
                               <br/>Kyle describes her as "really nice.".</p>

                               Kyle likes video games and comic books, but not sports…though he did a stint as a  photographer for his college newspaper’s sports section. He was born in Houma, and grew up in Bourg, LA. In his high school years he was a band geek and a member of drum corps and he was in the drama club both as an actor and set builder (ask him about his set for the high school’s production of The Wizard of Oz in 2000.) He was voted most likely to be a millionaire, but as yet has fallen a little short, though with his drive, it’s only a matter of time! As part of his graduate program he did some installations for “Give Kids the World” and continues to volunteer as a mentor with St. Bellarmine’s youth group.
<br/>
Heather describes him as a kind, goal-driven guy, who only sees the good in people..</p>

                            <h2>OUR STORY</h2>
                            <p>This inseparable couple wasn’t always inseparable. In 2005 they were both cast in 

Disney internships. They met when Kyle started dating Heather’s roommate (wah 

waah!) But they became friends, and remained friends through all of the changes 

they both encountered over the years.</p><p> Kyle was career driven and was soon in 

California. Heather was information driven and returned to school for a second 

degree in NY. Over the years there were various emails, instant messages, consoling 

over loses and flirting between relationships.</p><p> Despite the distance (or maybe 

because of it) a genuine, no-secrets friendship grew. In 2013, fate stepped in to see 

them through [see what I did there?] Kyle was on project, working in Disney World. 

Heather was on a lady’s Disney vacation in celebration of her mother’s birthday. 

They decided to meet for a drink. Kyle picked her up, had a short introduction to the 

ladies, and on their way to his car he said "I just have to stop by All Star Music, to fix 

a few things that we’re working on. It should only take about 20 minutes." 3 hours 

later, the two plus Jeff, Jaquie and Kaitlyn were sitting on the floor, throwing magic 

bands at a display that wouldn’t work. Kyle moved his hand over to Heather’s and 

that was it. </p><p> The next day (or at normal hours that same day) they stole a half hour 

together at La Cava Del Tequila in EPCOT before Kyle’s flight back to the west coast. 

He played it cool, but Kyle was convinced, and Heather knew, that this was "it."</p>
